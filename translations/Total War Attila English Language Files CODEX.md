## Step 1: Download the English Language Pack
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the English language pack for Total War: Attila. You can find it on various torrent sites or file hosting services. The file size is around 2 GB and it contains three files: `local_en.pack`, `local_en_2.pack`, and `local_en_gc.pack`. These are the files that contain the text and audio for the English version of the game.
 
## Step 2: Install the Language Pack
 
Once you have downloaded the language pack, you need to install it into your game installation folder. The default location is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Total War Attila\data`, but it may vary depending on where you installed the game. To install the language pack, simply run the `setup.exe` file and follow the instructions. Make sure you select the correct destination folder for your game.
 
## Step 3: Delete or Rename Other Language Files
 
The next step is to delete or rename any other language files that may be present in your game data folder. These files may have names like `local_de.pack`, `local_es.pack`, `local_fr.pack`, etc. depending on what language you downloaded. You can either delete them or rename them by adding an underscore at the beginning (e.g. `_local_de.pack`). This will prevent them from interfering with the English language pack.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy the Game in English
 
The final step is to launch the game and enjoy it in English. You should see the option to select English as your language in the game launcher. If not, you can manually edit the `steam_api.ini` file in your game folder and change the line that says `Language=russian` (or whatever language you have) to `Language=english`. Save the file and run the game again.
 
Congratulations! You have successfully changed the language of Total War: Attila to English using the CODEX release. Now you can immerse yourself in the epic battles and historical events of this period. Have fun!
